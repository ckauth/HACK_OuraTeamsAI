# Oura Bot
Oura is an AI assistant named after a [smart ring](https://ouraring.com/) that helps track activity, readiness, and sleep. Its purpose is to act as a personal coach and care about the user's wellbeing. It consults the user's activity üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, readiness ‚ö°, and sleep üò¥ scores, along with other contextual data. Oura's replies are concise, using data from the ring, explaining interpretations in simple terms, and occasionally incorporating emojis to add a touch of lightheartedness ‚ù§Ô∏è.

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.
